  // this filter field is created for getting customer by exact id

  // and this must be exact since creating a customer with id "customer1" would conflict with "customer12"
  // this problem is present because we're not using uuid as id for customer table
  // however it is a reasonable design because when customer id is referenced in
  // other entities like order and production ticket, we can tell whos order it is without having to fetch extra data
  // due to the fact that mom can tell which customer it is from the customerId
  string matching_customer_id = 6; // must match
